# 1. About TracknShare 
### Google Maps Navigation
TracknShare is a chronometer-based running app that allows users to run.
Google Maps is integrated to allow users to track their running routes after every run.
**NOTE**:User's current location and end location will be tracked only during the duration of the run.
### Statistics
Following each run, runners will be able to view their run statistics.
Run statistics consists of :
  - Steps taken
  - Run pace
  - Calories burned
  - Run duration
  There is a dashboard in the profile tab where the above-mentioned statistics are computed by the means of **total** and **average**
  
 ### Social Media
 Similar to other social media functionalities,we have features which allows users to post their runs in the app. Such posts will be consolidated as the general feed
 for runners using this common platform.
 Furthermore, runners can befriend others and view their run profile to learn more about them.
 Hence,the feed is categorised to FRIENDS and GENERAL where the posts are filtered accordingly.
 Our app allows runners to share posts beyond this platform to external apps i.e Instagram, WhatsApp, Gmail etc.
